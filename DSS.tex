\begin{abstract}
Floods are among the most common and damaging natural disasters in Indonesia, creating major challenges for emergency response and humanitarian logistics. This study develops a simulation-based Decision Support System (DSS) that combines fuzzy logic and a greedy algorithm to support more effective logistics planning in flood situations.

The DSS assigns priority to sub-districts based on key indicators, such as population characteristics, risk exposure, and access to health services, using a fuzzy inference system. The output from this system is then processed using a greedy algorithm that considers both the urgency of each location and its distance from nearby warehouses. This helps determine the order and routing of aid delivery.

The simulation was applied to eleven flood-prone sub-districts in Bogor Regency, using data from the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) and the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency (BPS). The results show that the system is able to schedule aid distribution across six days using three warehouses. All high-priority areas received assistance within the first two days.

The DSS shows potential to improve disaster response by supporting faster and fairer decisions under uncertainty. Its design allows for adaptation to other disaster types and different regions. The use of simple algorithms and structured data also makes it suitable for real-world application by government agencies or humanitarian organizations. This study highlights how data-driven approaches can be used to strengthen logistics planning in Indonesia’s disaster management system.

\section{Introduction}

Natural disasters are among the most persistent threats to human life and infrastructure worldwide. Globally, climate-related disasters accounted for 91\% of the 7,255 major recorded events between 1998 and 2017, with floods (43.4\%) and storms (28.2\%) being the most frequent types \cite{teh2021types}. 
Indonesia is particularly vulnerable due to its unique geological location at the convergence of three major tectonic plates, making it prone to both geophysical and climate-induced disasters, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and tsunamis \cite{hakim2020review}. 
Historically, the Indonesian archipelago has played a central role in the narrative of global natural disasters. Traditional records from Java and Bali, dating back to the eighth century, provide rich documentation of disaster occurrences across centuries \cite{sastrawan2022portents}.
Among these disaster types, floods stand out as the most frequent, damaging, and recurrent events in Indonesia \cite{merten2021rising}. They pose a significant threat to both urban and rural communities and are consistently the leading cause of natural disaster events and losses \cite{jamshed2020conceptual}. Floods remain the central focus of this study due to their overwhelming frequency and wide-reaching impact. In urban centers like Jakarta, floods regularly disrupt transportation, damage infrastructure, and threaten livelihoods \cite{sholihah2020analysis}. 
Based on Table~\ref{tab:disaster2025}, the occurrence of natural disasters in Indonesia is still predominantly caused by floods. Therefore, the ability to respond rapidly to such disasters is critical, as it can significantly impact the well-being of affected populations.
\begin{table}[H]

\label{tab:disaster2025}
\end{table}

Eventhought flood frequency happened, flood mitigation capacity in Indonesia remains limited, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive and strategic improvements in disaster preparedness and response \cite{riza2020advancing}.
In disaster response operations, the efficiency of logistics and supply chain systems is a critical determinant of how quickly and effectively aid reaches affected populations \cite{ma2022critical}. However, Indonesia's current disaster logistics systems are hindered by systemic issues, such as the lack of integrated control mechanisms and insufficient coordination among stakeholders \cite{rustian2021implementation}. These weaknesses often result in delayed response times, misallocation of resources, and reduced service coverage in disaster-stricken areas. Figure~\ref{fig:floodimpact} illustrates the distribution of impacts caused by flood disaster events in Indonesia from 2010 to 2025, highlighting flood-related damage as the most frequent and significant consequence. This underscores the urgent need for effective decision support systems to enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of humanitarian logistics in disaster response scenarios.

    \vspace{0.2cm}

\end{figure}

Moreover, research on risk management within emergency supply chains remains scarce. Many existing studies lack the practical and integrated methodologies needed to support real-time decision-making under conditions of uncertainty \cite{chukwuka2023comprehensive}. This gap underscores the necessity for intelligent decision support tools capable of managing disruptions in complex humanitarian logistics environments.
One such emerging approach is the development of resilient supply chains, defined as systems that can recover and return to normal operations within an acceptable timeframe following a disruption \cite{orengo2022food}. Building this resilience requires not only robust planning but also adaptive, intelligent frameworks that can prioritize needs dynamically and optimize resource allocation in real time \cite{ramirez2020sustainability}.

This study addresses these challenges by proposing a simulation-based Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates fuzzy inference and a greedy algorithm to provide a rapid, adaptive response mechanism during natural disasters. The system is designed specifically with flood response scenarios in mind, aiming to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of humanitarian supply chains through real-time prioritization and resource allocation. To support this, the simulation utilizes data from the Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS) and historical disaster records from the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) to identify high-risk regions and evaluate logistical response scenarios.

\section{Literature Review}

Decision Support Systems (DSS) play a crucial role in disaster management by supporting data-driven decisions under uncertainty \cite{khan2023systematic}. These systems integrate real-time information, simulation models, and analytical tools to guide emergency response actions \cite{alghodhaifi2021autonomous}. DSS have been shown to improve situational awareness, stakeholder coordination, and response time \cite{adetiloye2021collaboration}. For example, Peron et al. (2022) demonstrated how a DSS improved workforce management, highlighting its utility in coordinating limited human resources during crises \cite{peron2022decision}. Furthermore, Suarez et al. (2024) emphasized the importance of incorporating demographic data and historical records to enhance system responsiveness \cite{suarez2024integrated}.

Simulation-based methods have been widely adopted in logistics and disaster management research due to their ability to model complex, dynamic systems without the risk and cost of real-world deployment \cite{chang2022simulation}. These models can forecast affected regions, estimate victim counts, and test operational strategies before implementation. Lobkov et al. (2023) used simulation to predict population-level impact zones, emphasizing the need for precise data preprocessing \cite{lobkov2023determination}.

Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) provide a robust framework for reasoning in situations involving uncertainty and ambiguity. In disaster contexts, fuzzy systems help prioritize victims and areas based on partially known data such as health status, risk levels, and location \cite{anjomshoae2021integrated}. FIS supports flexible and adaptive logic that mirrors human reasoning, allowing for better interpretation of uncertain field conditions \cite{improta2020fuzzy}.
Fuzzy logic allows the translation of expert judgment into computational rules. Crisp inputs are fuzzified using membership functions such as the trapezoidal function:

\[
\mu_A(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & x \leq a \\
\frac{x - a}{b - a}, & a < x < b \\
1, & b \leq x \leq c \\
\frac{d - x}{d - c}, & c < x < d \\
0, & x \geq d
\end{cases}
\]

Rules are evaluated using logical operators like \textit{min} for AND and \textit{max} for aggregation:

\[
\mu_{\text{Rule}} = \min\left( \mu_{\text{Health}}(x), \mu_{\text{Age}}(y), \mu_{\text{Risk}}(z) \right)
\]

\[
\mu_{\text{Output}}(z) = \max \left( \mu_{\text{Rule}_1}(z), \mu_{\text{Rule}_2}(z),\dots \right)
\]

Crisp outputs are obtained using defuzzification techniques like the centroid method:

\[
z^* = \frac{\int z \cdot \mu(z) \, dz}{\int \mu(z) \, dz}
\]

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms for Disaster Logistics Optimization}
Greedy algorithms offer computational efficiency by selecting the locally optimal choice at each step with the aim of finding a global optimum. In logistics, they are used for route optimization, resource allocation, and task scheduling, especially under real-time constraints \cite{garcia2025greedy}.
According Zhao et al. basic greedy algorithm for routing logistics aid can be formulated as follows \cite{zhao2021iterated}:

\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Initialize list of affected districts $D = \{d_1, d_2, ..., d_n\}$
\STATE Let $P(d_i)$ be the priority score (based on fuzzy output)
\STATE Let $Dist(d_i)$ be the distance from the warehouse to district $d_i$
\STATE Compute Greedy Score $G(d_i) = \alpha \cdot P(d_i) - \beta \cdot Dist(d_i)$
\STATE Sort $D$ by $G(d_i)$ in descending order
\FOR{each $d_i$ in sorted $D$}
    \STATE Dispatch logistics to $d_i$ (if resources available)
    \STATE Update resource and capacity
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are weight coefficients for priority and distance
    \item $P(d_i)$ reflects urgency and need (e.g., fuzzy score: 0 to 2)
    \item $Dist(d_i)$ is the geographical distance from logistics center
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State of Art}
Despite the advancements in DSS, simulation, fuzzy logic, and greedy algorithms, several gaps remain in the current literature that this study aims to address:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DSS Limitations:} Many systems focus on strategic or macro-level planning, with limited capability for real-time, field-level decision-making. There is also a lack of integration with community-specific vulnerability indicators \cite{steinhauser2025understanding}.
    \item \textbf{Simulation Constraints:} Existing simulation studies often overlook last-mile logistics and demographic variability, limiting their usefulness for granular, operational decisions \cite{ampaw2025developing}.
    \item \textbf{FIS Application Gaps:} While fuzzy systems are widely accepted for classification tasks, they are rarely embedded into real-time logistics pipelines. There's minimal exploration of how fuzzy rules based on humanitarian principles can shape logistical resource allocation \cite{anjomshoae2021integrated, improta2020fuzzy, jain2020membership, yoon2023novel}.
    \item \textbf{Greedy Algorithm Narrow Use:} Most greedy algorithms are used for cost or distance minimization alone, neglecting contextual factors such as population vulnerability, urgency, or fairness in resource allocation \cite{shirmarz2020adaptive, hamidouglu2023game}.
\end{itemize}

By addressing these gaps, this study proposes an integrated fuzzy-greedy simulation-based DSS tailored for prioritizing victims and optimizing humanitarian logistics in Indonesian disaster scenarios.


\section{Methodology} 

This study adopts a simulation-based quantitative approach to evaluate the performance of an intelligent Decision Support System (DSS) for humanitarian logistics in disaster response. The proposed framework is designed to integrate fuzzy inference and greedy optimization, enabling adaptive prioritization and routing of aid under uncertain and time-sensitive conditions.
The research framework comprises four key components: data acquisition, fuzzy inference system (FIS), greedy algorithm, and simulation-based evaluation. Figure~\ref{fig:research_framework} illustrates the sequential flow from data preprocessing to logistics simulation.

\label{fig:research_framework}
\end{figure}

The system begins by collecting spatial, demographic, and disaster data from the Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS) and the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB). This data includes sub-district population characteristics, health facility availability, disaster frequency, and geographic coordinates.
These data points are transformed into qualitative variables such as health vulnerability, age-based sensitivity, hazard exposure, and accessibility. A Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is employed to convert these inputs into a continuous priority index using linguistic rules aligned with humanitarian standards (e.g., SPHERE Handbook).

Subsequently, the priority index is passed to a greedy algorithm, which integrates proximity to warehouses and urgency of need to compute a composite delivery score. This step facilitates optimized resource allocation by ranking the districts based on a trade-off between importance and logistical distance.
Finally, the entire DSS pipeline is evaluated through simulation, where disaster scenarios are modeled over multiple days. The system performance is assessed based on delivery efficiency, prioritization accuracy, and coverage of affected populations. This simulation-based evaluation ensures that the DSS is both theoretically sound and practically applicable to real-world disaster logistics operations.


\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Data Simulation}

Many studies involves a simulation-based approach to evaluate the performance of a Decision Support System (DSS)\cite{he2020dynamic}. This approach allows for the modeling of complex systems and the assessment of various scenarios without the need for real-world implementation\cite{latchmore2023integrating}. This study collects and processes data from the Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS) and the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) to simulate disaster scenarios using Docling to extract the data \cite{Docling}. Determining the most affected regions and the number of victims is crucial for effective disaster response planning \cite{endo2020estimating}. The simulation framework incorporates demographic data, historical disaster records, and geographical information \cite{santos2020workforce}. Determining the most affected regions and the number of victims is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulationframework}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig4.png}

\end{figure}
Based on heatmap the west Java region is the most occurrences based on floods natural disaster, then districs of Bogor, Bandung, and Bekasi are the most affected areas, can be shwon in Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap2}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig5.png}}

    \label{fig:heatmap2}
    \footnotesize{\textit{Source:} \url{https://dibi.bnpb.go.id}}
\end{figure} 
After identifying the most affected regions, the next step is to analyze the flood potential in each sub-district. This analysis is based on spatial data and hydrological information, which are crucial for understanding the flood risk and planning effective disaster response strategies.
Making sure that the simulation accurately reflects the real-world conditions faced during disaster response operations. Spatial analysis hydrological data is also integrated to assess the impact of floods \cite{alkaesi2021spatial}. Result of analysis is shown in table \ref{tab:analysis}.
\begin{table}[H]

\end{center}
\end{table}

Based on the analysis, the simulation will be taken on sub districs are identified as having extreme ,high, and normal flood potential. This information is used in simulation after adding demographic data from BPS, which includes population density and socio-economic indicators. The simulation framework is designed to model the logistics and supply chain operations during disaster response, focusing on the allocation of resources and routing of aid based on the severity and urgency of the situation \cite{park2021architectural}. Warehouse locations is based on the proximity to affected areas, ensuring that resources can be deployed quickly and efficiently \cite{halawa2020introduction}.  

\subsection{Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Greedy Algorithm}
The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is employed to assess the severity and urgency of disasters, providing a flexible framework for decision-making under uncertainty \cite{berawi2020prioritized}. According Berawi et al. following Fuzzy rules are generated :

\begin{itemize}
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Sick}, AND Age is \textbf{Adult} or \textbf{Kid}, AND Risk Level is \textbf{High} or \textbf{Moderate}, THEN the victim is \textbf{Prioritized}.
    
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Sick}, AND Age is \textbf{Adult} or \textbf{Kid}, AND Risk Level is \textbf{Low}, THEN the victim is \textbf{Prioritized}.
    
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Sick}, AND Age is \textbf{Elder}, AND Distance is \textbf{Far} or \textbf{Nearby}, THEN the victim is \textbf{Prioritized}.
    
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Sick}, AND Age is \textbf{Elder}, AND Distance is \textbf{Moderate}, THEN the victim is \textbf{Prioritized}.
    
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Healthy} or \textbf{Okay}, AND Age is \textbf{Elder} or \textbf{Kid}, AND Risk Level is \textbf{Moderate}, THEN the victim is \textbf{not Prioritized}.
    
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Healthy} or \textbf{Okay}, AND Age is \textbf{Elder} or \textbf{Kid}, AND Risk Level is \textbf{High}, THEN the victim is \textbf{not Prioritized}.
    
    \item IF Healthy Level is \textbf{Healthy} or \textbf{Okay}, AND Age is \textbf{Adult}, THEN the victim is \textbf{not Prioritized}.
\end{itemize}

Fuzzy logic allows for the incorporation of expert knowledge and subjective assessments, enabling the system to handle imprecise and ambiguous data effectively \cite{jain2020membership}. The model is highly flexible and can be adjusted according to the actual conditions of the damaged area. In the development of the membership function, contextual parameters must be carefully defined based on observed field data \cite{amiri2021application}. fuzzy rules were made to determine the relationship between independent and dependent variables \cite{yoon2023novel}. The rules are defined based on expert knowledge and historical data, allowing the system to evaluate the impact of disasters on affected regions \cite{wang2024gis}. This study use SPHERE handbook as a reference for the fuzzy rules, which are designed to prioritize disaster impact zones based on severity, urgency, and accessibility \cite{sphere2018pdf}. Table \ref{tab:dependent_variables_sphere} is dependent variables from SPHERE handbook.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Potential Dependent Variables Aligned with the Sphere Handbook Principles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Dependent Variable} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Relevance to Sphere Handbook} \\
\hline
Response Time & Time required to deliver aid to affected populations (e.g., hours) & Timeliness and accessibility of humanitarian assistance \\
\hline
Coverage of Affected Population & Proportion (\%) of disaster victims who receive aid & Non-discrimination, equity, and universal access \\
\hline
Logistics Efficiency & Efficiency in terms of cost, distance, or load (e.g., ton/km or cost per beneficiary) & Effective resource utilization and accountability \\
\hline
Unmet Needs Score & Index measuring the gap in critical needs (e.g., shelter, food, WASH) & Fulfillment of minimum humanitarian standards \\
\hline
Protection or Satisfaction Index & Victim-reported perception of safety, dignity, and fairness (via surveys or scoring) & Protection, dignity, and community engagement \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:dependent_variables_sphere}
\end{center}
\end{table}


After rules are defined, the FIS is implemented using the Mamdani method, which is suitable for handling complex and non-linear relationships in disaster scenarios \cite{herpratiwi2022implementation}. Greedy algorithm is used to optimize resource allocation and routing based on the priority indices generated by the FIS \cite{shirmarz2020adaptive}. The greedy algorithm is chosen for its efficiency in finding near-optimal solutions in complex logistics problems, particularly in dynamic environments where rapid decision-making is crucial \cite{hamidouglu2023game}. The combination of FIS and greedy algorithm allows for a robust decision support system that can adapt to changing conditions and prioritize resources effectively during disaster response operations.

    \item Warehouse 1: \((-6.484578, 106.838395)\)
    \item Warehouse 2: \((-6.524798, 106.770716)\)
    \item Warehouse 3: \((-6.576941, 106.777883)\)
\end{itemize}

These points represent accessible positions distributed across Bogor Regency, enabling effective coverage of both central and remote sub-districts. Figure~\ref{fig:warehouse_location} shows the locations of all three warehouses.

The simulation calculates the distance from each district to the nearest warehouse using the haversine formula, which accounts for the curvature of the Earth. The coordinates of each district are obtained from BPS data, while the warehouse locations are based on strategic logistics planning.
Using these locations, the haversine distance formula was applied to calculate the shortest distance between each district and the closest warehouse. This proximity is then combined with fuzzy logic prioritization and Sphere-based needs assessment. A greedy algorithm is implemented to generate a ranked delivery sequence for each district.

Distances from each district to the nearest warehouse were shown in Table~\ref{tab:distance_matrix}.

\label{tab:distance_matrix}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The distances were calculated using the haversine formula, which is suitable for calculating distances between two points on the Earth's surface given their latitude and longitude coordinates. To determine routing priority, a greedy scoring function was used, defined as:

\begin{equation}
G_i = \alpha \cdot P_i - \beta \cdot D_i
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( G_i \): Greedy score for district \( i \)
    \item \( P_i \): Fuzzy priority (High = 2, Low = 1)
    \item \( D_i \): Distance from the nearest warehouse (km)
    \item \( \alpha = 100 \), \( \beta = 1 \)
\end{itemize}

This formula balances the urgency of need (fuzzy priority) against the logistical efficiency (distance), allowing for rapid prioritization of districts based on both their immediate requirements and accessibility.
Using the above formula, the greedy scores for each district were calculated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Babakanmadang (Warehouse 3): \( G = 100 \cdot 3 - 8.65 = 291.35 \)
    \item Pamijahan (Warehouse 3): \( G = 100 \cdot 2 - 14.04 = 185.96 \)
    \item Megamendung (Warehouse 3): \( G = 100 \cdot 3 - 18.51 = 281.49 \)
    \item Tanjungsari (Warehouse 1): \( G = 100 \cdot 3 - 25.18 = 274.82 \)
    \item Nanggung (Warehouse 2): \( G = 100 \cdot 3 - 30.34 = 269.66 \)
    \item Cigudeg (Warehouse 2): \( G = 100 \cdot 2 - 30.44 = 169.56 \)
    \item Sukamakmur (Warehouse 1): \( G = 100 \cdot 3 - 29.88 = 270.12 \)
    \item Sukajaya (Warehouse 2): \( G = 100 \cdot 2 - 39.21 = 160.79 \)
    \item Jasinga (Warehouse 2): \( G = 100 \cdot 1 - 42.96 = 57.04 \)
    \item Rumpin (Warehouse 2): \( G = 100 \cdot 1 - 19.45 = 80.55 \)
    \item Tenjo Panjang (Warehouse 2): \( G = 100 \cdot 1 - 45.30 = 54.70 \)
\end{itemize}


The greedy algorithm ranks districts to balance urgency and logistics efficiency. Table~\ref{tab:greedy_multiwh} summarizes the results.

This prioritization forms the foundation for an adaptive logistics routing strategy. Table~\ref{tab:distribution_schedule} presents the optimized delivery schedule, in which each warehouse operates concurrently and delivers to the nearest high-priority district based on the remaining greedy scores. To maximize efficiency and reduce idle time, each warehouse is limited to serving one district per day. This approach ensures rapid aid deployment while balancing urgency and geographical proximity.

\footnotesize{\textit{Note:} Only one district is served per warehouse per day. Prioritization is based on greedy scores, using proximity to assigned warehouse.}
\end{table}

This schedule ensures full utilization of warehouse resources while maintaining alignment with priority rankings. All critical districts (greedy score $>$ 260) are served within the first two days. The remaining moderate- and low-priority districts are systematically scheduled without overburdening any single warehouse. This structure highlights the ability of the DSS to support scalable, parallelized logistics planning under real-world constraints.
The simulation results indicate that the proposed DSS can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response logistics in West Bogor. 

\section{Conclusion}

This study presents a simulation-based Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates fuzzy inference and a greedy algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian logistics in disaster response, specifically focusing on flood-prone regions in West Java, Indonesia. By leveraging demographic data, health infrastructure indicators, and risk exposure metrics, the system produces a dynamic prioritization of affected sub-districts through fuzzy logic. These priority scores are then combined with spatial proximity data using a greedy optimization approach to generate an efficient logistics delivery schedule from multiple warehouses.

The simulation results demonstrate the system's ability to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prioritize regions with the greatest humanitarian need based on multidimensional vulnerability factors.
    \item Optimize resource allocation across three strategically located warehouses using proximity and urgency-based scoring.
    \item Ensure equitable and efficient logistics routing, with all high-priority districts served within the first two operational days.
\end{itemize}

The DSS shows strong potential in addressing common challenges in disaster logistics, including delayed response, resource misallocation, and limited accessibility to remote areas. The model provides a structured framework for rapid decision-making under uncertainty, aligning with the humanitarian standards outlined in the SPHERE handbook.
From a methodological perspective, the integration of fuzzy inference and greedy heuristics proves to be a robust hybrid approach that balances qualitative expert rules with quantitative spatial optimization. The modular architecture of the system also enables adaptability to other disaster types and regional contexts.
Future works may focus on several enhancements: (i) incorporation of real-time data streams (e.g., weather APIs, crowd-sourced reports) to improve responsiveness; (ii) integration with GIS-based route planning tools for more granular path optimization; and (iii) extension to multi-modal logistics scenarios (air, land, and sea transport) to increase system applicability in larger-scale disasters. Moreover, machine learning models could be introduced to predict demand patterns or dynamically adjust priority scores based on unfolding field conditions.

In conclusion, this research provides a novel contribution to the field of humanitarian logistics by demonstrating how intelligent decision support tools can systematically enhance disaster preparedness and response. The proposed fuzzy-greedy DSS framework offers a scalable, adaptive, and context-sensitive solution to improve aid delivery outcomes in disaster-prone regions.
