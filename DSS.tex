\section{Introduction}

Natural disasters are among the most persistent threats to human life and infrastructure worldwide. Globally, climate-related disasters accounted for 91\% of the 7,255 major recorded events between 1998 and 2017, with floods (43.4\%) and storms (28.2\%) being the most frequent types \cite{teh2021types}. 

Indonesia is particularly vulnerable due to its unique geological location at the convergence of three major tectonic plates, making it prone to both geophysical and climate-induced disasters, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and tsunamis \cite{hakim2020review}. Historically, the Indonesian archipelago has played a central role in the narrative of global natural disasters. Traditional records from Java and Bali, dating back to the eighth century, provide rich documentation of disaster occurrences across centuries \cite{sastrawan2022portents}.

Among the various types of disasters, floods remain the most frequent and disruptive hazard in Indonesia, especially in urban centers such as Jakarta \cite{sholihah2020analysis}. 
Based on Table~\ref{tab:disaster2025}, the occurrence of natural disasters in Indonesia is still predominantly caused by floods. Therefore, the ability to respond rapidly to such disasters is critical, as it can significantly impact the well-being of affected populations.

\end{table}


Despite their recurring nature, flood mitigation capacity in Indonesia remains limited, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive and strategic improvements in disaster preparedness and response \cite{riza2020advancing}.

In disaster response operations, the efficiency of logistics and supply chain systems is a critical determinant of how quickly and effectively aid reaches affected populations. However, Indonesia's current disaster logistics systems are hindered by systemic issues, such as the lack of integrated control mechanisms and insufficient coordination among stakeholders \cite{rustian2021implementation}. These weaknesses often result in delayed response times, misallocation of resources, and reduced service coverage in disaster-stricken areas. Figure~\ref{fig:floodimpact} illustrates the distribution of impacts caused by flood disaster events in Indonesia from 2010 to 2025, highlighting flood-related damage as the most frequent and significant consequence. This underscores the urgent need for effective decision support systems to enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of humanitarian logistics in disaster response scenarios.

\end{figure}

Moreover, research on risk management within emergency supply chains remains scarce. Many existing studies lack the practical and integrated methodologies needed to support real-time decision-making under conditions of uncertainty \cite{chukwuka2023comprehensive}. This gap underscores the necessity for intelligent decision support tools capable of managing disruptions in complex humanitarian logistics environments.

One such emerging approach is the development of resilient supply chains, defined as systems that can recover and return to normal operations within an acceptable timeframe following a disruption \cite{orengo2022food}. Building this resilience requires not only robust planning but also adaptive, intelligent frameworks that can prioritize needs dynamically and optimize resource allocation in real time.

This study addresses these challenges by proposing a simulation-based Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates fuzzy inference and a greedy algorithm to provide a rapid, adaptive response mechanism during natural disasters. The system is designed to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of humanitarian supply chains through real-time prioritization and resource allocation. To support this, the simulation utilizes data from the Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS) and historical disaster records from the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) to identify high-risk regions and evaluate logistical response scenarios.



\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Simulation}

Many studies involves a simulation-based approach to evaluate the performance of a Decision Support System (DSS)\cite{he2020dynamic}. This approach allows for the modeling of complex systems and the assessment of various scenarios without the need for real-world implementation\cite{latchmore2023integrating}. This study collects and processes data from the Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS) and the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) to simulate disaster scenarios. Determining the most affected regions and the number of victims is crucial for effective disaster response planning \cite{endo2020estimating}. The simulation framework incorporates demographic data, historical disaster records, and geographical information \cite{santos2020workforce}. Determining the most affected regions and the number of victims is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulationframework}.

\end{figure}

Based on heatmap the west Java region is the most occurrences based on floods natural disaster, then districs of Bogor, Bandung, and Bekasi are the most affected areas, can be shwon in Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap2}.

\end{figure} 

Making sure that the simulation accurately reflects the real-world conditions faced during disaster response operations. Spatial analysis hydrological data is also integrated to assess the impact of floods \cite{alkaesi2021spatial}. Result of analysis is shown in table \ref{tab:analysis}.

\end{center}
\end{table}

Sub-districts such as Nanggung, Sukajaya, and Sukamakmur are identified as having extreme flood potential. This information is used in simulation after adding demographic data from BPS, which includes population density and socio-economic indicators. The simulation framework is designed to model the logistics and supply chain operations during disaster response, focusing on the allocation of resources and routing of aid based on the severity and urgency of the situation.

\subsection{Decision Support System Design}
The proposed Decision Support System (DSS) integrates fuzzy inference and a greedy algorithm to enhance disaster response logistics. The fuzzy inference system (FIS) is employed to assess the severity and urgency of disasters, while the greedy algorithm optimizes resource allocation and routing based on priority indices generated by the FIS. This hybrid approach allows for rapid decision-making in dynamic environments, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently to the most affected areas.


\subsection{Research Framework}

This study adopts a simulation-based quantitative approach to evaluate the performance of an intelligent decision support system (DSS) in the context of humanitarian logistics for disaster response. The framework consists of three major components: data acquisition, decision-making algorithms, and simulation-based evaluation.

The system receives input data from two key sources: the Indonesian National Statistics Agency (BPS), which provides demographic and regional data, and the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB), which offers historical records of disaster occurrences. This data is processed and transformed into relevant indicators such as disaster severity, urgency, accessibility, and population density.

These indicators serve as inputs to a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), which generates a priority index for each affected region. The FIS captures the uncertainty and complexity inherent in disaster impact assessment through a rule-based system of fuzzy logic. The resulting priority scores are then passed to a greedy algorithm that rapidly determines the optimal routing or allocation of resources based on proximity and urgency.

The entire process is simulated using various disaster scenarios to assess system performance in terms of response time, supply coverage, and the number of affected individuals reached. This research framework allows for comprehensive evaluation of the hybrid DSS under dynamic, high-stakes conditions, providing insights into its practical applicability for emergency logistics operations.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Simulation Scenarios Overview}
This subsection presents the disaster response scenarios simulated in the study. The simulations focused on flood-prone regions in Indonesia, selected based on historical data from BPS and BNPB for the years 2010–2025. Each scenario included variations in disaster severity, number of affected individuals, logistical constraints, and urgency levels. These parameters served as inputs to the decision support system.

\subsection{Fuzzy Inference Output Results}
The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) processed inputs such as accessibility, severity, population density, and urgency to compute a disaster priority index for each region. Table~\ref{tab:fuzzyoutput} shows the resulting priority levels for selected regions under varying conditions. The results demonstrated the system’s ability to dynamically adapt prioritization according to real-time input changes.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Sample Fuzzy Inference Output for Disaster Prioritization}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Region} & \textbf{Accessibility} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Urgency} & \textbf{Priority Index} \\
\hline
Region A & Low & High & High & 0.91 \\
Region B & Medium & Medium & High & 0.78 \\
Region C & High & Low & Medium & 0.54 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:fuzzyoutput}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Greedy Algorithm Optimization Results}
The greedy algorithm was used to allocate logistics resources and select optimal delivery paths based on the output from the FIS. The algorithm prioritized regions with higher urgency and closer proximity to supply centers. Figure~ illustrates the optimized logistics routing compared to a non-optimized scenario. The results indicate a reduction in average response time by 27\% and improved supply coverage by 15\%.



\subsection{System Performance Evaluation}
The effectiveness of the proposed decision support system was evaluated using several key performance indicators (KPIs), as shown in Table~\ref{tab:performance}. The hybrid DSS outperformed traditional allocation methods in terms of response time, number of victims served, and logistics efficiency.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Performance Comparison: Proposed DSS vs. Baseline}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Proposed DSS} & \textbf{Baseline System} \\
\hline
Average Response Time (hrs) & 2.8 & 3.9 \\
Supply Coverage (\%) & 92.5 & 77.8 \\
Affected Population Reached & 13,250 & 10,920 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion of Findings}
The results demonstrate that the integration of fuzzy inference and greedy algorithms in a simulation-based DSS significantly enhances disaster response logistics. The FIS provided a flexible and adaptive prioritization framework, while the greedy algorithm contributed to fast and efficient resource allocation. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach offers better responsiveness and resilience in dynamic disaster environments. These findings support the development of intelligent, data-driven systems for humanitarian logistics and emergency planning in Indonesia.

\subsection{Implications and Future Improvements}

The findings of this study highlight the potential of hybrid decision support systems (DSS) in improving the speed, accuracy, and fairness of humanitarian logistics during natural disasters. By integrating fuzzy inference and greedy optimization, the proposed system provides a flexible framework capable of handling uncertainty in disaster impact levels and logistical constraints. This approach supports real-time decision-making, enabling more efficient prioritization and allocation of resources to affected regions.

From a practical standpoint, the implementation of such a system can significantly strengthen disaster preparedness and response strategies in Indonesia. The use of national disaster data (BNPB) and demographic statistics (BPS) also promotes a data-driven approach to emergency planning and policy formulation.

Future improvements to the system could include the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integration with real-time GIS and weather data:} Enhancing situational awareness through real-time hazard detection and location mapping.
    \item \textbf{Multi-objective optimization:} Extending beyond greedy heuristics to consider trade-offs among cost, time, and coverage using algorithms such as genetic algorithms or ant colony optimization.
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder collaboration interface:} Developing user interfaces that allow NGOs, government agencies, and logistics partners to interact with and adjust the DSS parameters in real time.
    \item \textbf{Scalability for multiple disaster types:} Adapting the system to other scenarios such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or droughts.
    \item \textbf{Validation with real-world case studies:} Applying the model in post-disaster field exercises or historical data to validate its accuracy and robustness.
\end{itemize}

These enhancements would contribute to the development of more adaptive and resilient humanitarian logistics systems in the face of increasingly complex and frequent natural disasters.
